DoneJS is a compilation of the best technology for every aspect of developing a complex JavaScript app, all working together seamlessly.

Our mission is to enable the JavaScript community to make amazing apps - high performance, maintainable, and highly usable -  by default.

And as times change and new techniques emerge, we'll continue improving the stack, providing a simple upgrade path along the way.

To us, enabling the community is about more than code - it means meeting, teaching, sharing ideas, and project collaboration. We want to make our community - those that use DoneJS and any of its pieces - stronger, through relationships, communication, and skills.

DoneJS is rebuilt and rebranded from the 8+ year old [JavaScriptMVC](http://javascriptmvc.com) project. DoneJS is comprised of CanJS, StealJS, and many other sub-projects.

## Goals

DoneJS has three primary goals:

1.  To enable developers to easily create high performance, maintainable, highly usable (amazing) applications.
2.  To continually evolve with new techniques and tools.
3.  To support the technology community.

### Amazing Applications

Building a modern application is increasingly difficult. There are many competing concerns to balance.

It should be fast (that means many things). It should reach as many users as possible (run on every browser and platform).  It should provide a great user experience. 

It should also be maintainable, otherwise it will be too expensive in the long run.

And yet it needs to be done on time, making the previous requirements hard to fit in.

DoneJS aims to guide developers down a yellow brick road towards a successful JavaScript application: making every step towards an amazing application well lit and simple.

Our goal is to make it hard to NOT make an amazing application using DoneJS.

We aim to do this in three main ways:

1. Providing a full, integrated solution: literally everything you need to build a complex app.
1. Solving hard technical problems.
2. Providing tools that eliminate any barrier to "doing the right thing"

#### 1. Full stack

For any sufficiently complex application, there are many many layers of foundation needed. 

There are a ton of options out there, and so much to learn. The rise of the [micro-library](http://microjs.com/#) era has led to a time when picking your stack involves picking from thousands of potential options, and infinite possible combinations that have to work together well.

Having many small micro libraries to choose from sounds good in theory. In practice, we've found it presents more challenges than benefits.

How do you choose? How do you know if they fit well together? What if the industry changes (it will) and a year from now your stack is no longer maintained? How do you find support for your unique combination of tools?

More importantly, who has time for that?

DoneJS gives you a full solution: literally everything you need to build a complex app, working together seamlessly. Its our mission to eliminate any ambiguity around choosing technology for building an app, so you can spend time actually building your app. 

We've compiled best in class tools for every part of the JavaScript application lifecycle: from tooling, to application architecture, to production deployment.

Just like Apple owning the whole stack from software to hardware to retails makes for a great experience: the whole DoneJS stack is greater than the sum of its parts. A few examples:

* generators
* can-import
* server side rendering simplicity

#### 2. Hard technical problems

DoneJS aims to identify the hard parts of front-end development, and solve them, or at least make them as simple for developers as possible.

A few examples:

- Server Side Rendering
- Automatic real-time updates
- Builds to mobile and desktop
- Optimal builds deployed to a CDN

#### 3. Doing the right thing

To us, the `right thing` means doing the extra work that makes your code easier to debug and maintain: things like tests, docs, continuous integration, and deployment automation.

Often, there is a barrier to doing the right thing: finding the right tools, learning about them, setting up, and configuring them. DoneJS aims to remove this barrier, making doing the `right thing` simply part of the normal dev cycle.

- Tests and Documentation
- Guides for CI and CD
- Modlets
- Generators

### Evolve

Learn from others. Provide the ability to upgrade without having to rewrite everything.  Changes will happen,
but stepwise.  

Provide examples of this.

### Community

 - Teach - Our tech is worth nothing if people don't know how to use it.  We have a weekly training, and post
   training videos.  We also have "free" single trainings anywhere people can assemble 10 people.  If you'd
   like a free DoneJS training please email. Our full time team is always available to chat on gitter.
   
 - Explore - DoneJS's parts should work with everything.  StealJS works great with ReactJS.  CanJS works
   with RequireJS or Browserify.  can-connect works on its own.  Different combinations suite people differently.  
   Our goal is to enhance other communities with DoneJS's technology.
   
 - Attract - If you have the next great JS idea, we want to encourage you to help build it as part of the DoneJS
   family.  You'll find DoneJS a supportive environment to nurture your ideas.  You can even pair with the full
   time devs to build out your idea.


## History

DoneJS's history goes back more than 8 years!  Learn why JavaScriptMVC was started, and how it
evolved into DoneJS.

### Beginning Insipration

Brian and Justin were trying to make something like Filemaker pro, but for the web. They
were young and stupid.  To make something so complex, as a SPA, they need things like:

- Templates
- A build system
- Event delegation
- A model
- Testing

### Middle Challenges

Maintaining all these projects was too much. And it was a big pill to swallow. So we started to break out our tech.

And, these projects were based on Rhino, not node.  So we set out to update EVERYTHING and
solve some of the biggest remaining struggles - real-time, ssr, different builds.


### Today's Effort

After releasing DoneJS, our team will be almost exclusively focused on 
DoneJS's community, training, and documentation. DoneJS is amazing, but without getting
people the skills they need to effecitvely use it, it will go to waste.

- How can people get involved?
- 

### Tomorrow's Roadmap

- StealJS's dependency injection
- DirtyChecking 
- can-connect supporting other frameworks
- Other MV*\ support?
- Animation utilities

## Projects

DoneJS is comprised of many projects.  There are 1st party projects, where there
is a high degree of overlap of the teams working on these projects, and 3rd party projects like
jQuery that DoneJS uses, we occasionally contribute to, but are maintained by outside teams.

### CanJS

### can-ssr

### can-simple-dom

### StealJS

### steal-tools

### steal

### DocumentJS 

### FuncUnit

### jQuery++

### 3rd party projects

jQuery, QUnit, Cordova, NW.js



## Team

The DoneJS family of technologies is built by 100s of contributors:


### Core team

To become a contributor to DoneJS or its sub-projects, you simply have to:

- email the core team expressing your interest.
- attend a monthly meeting
- make one small contribution, even a spelling correction, a month.

### Fulltime team

 - David
 - Matthew
 - Justin

### Bitovi

Bitovi, a JavaScript consulting company, is the primary sponsor of DoneJS. If you would
like to sponsor development, please contact.
