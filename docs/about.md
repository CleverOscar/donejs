DoneJS' goal is to help the JavaScript community get amazing applications done fast.
Amazing applications are fast, sublimely usable, and maintainable.

But times change and new techniques emerge. We strive to adopt these
techniques, improve the stack, and provide a simple upgrade path along the way.

We are part of a community that helps developers of all skill levels and
backgrounds learn the technology, excel at it, and accomplish their
goals.

Learn about the goals, history, roadmap, and team behind DoneJS.

## Goals



DoneJS has three primary goals:

1.  To enable developers to easily create high performance, maintainable, highly usable (amazing) applications.
2.  To continually evolve with new techniques and tools.
3.  To support the technology community.

### Amazing Applications

Building a modern application is increasingly difficult. Your app
needs to look good and run fast on every
platform and browser.  And, you need to get your app done yesterday.
Not kinda done.  Done done.

Helping you get a high performance, sublimely usable, and maintainable application
done fast is DoneJS's primary goal. This is why our logo
is a browser that looks like a checkered flag. We're committed
to your release.

We aim to help in three main ways:

#### 1. Solving difficult technical problems

DoneJS has good solutions for:

 - [Builds to mobile and desktop](#section=section_iOS_Android_andDesktopBuilds)
 - [Server Side Rendering](#section=section_Server_SideRendered)
 - [Automatic real-time updates](#section=section_RealTimeConnected)
 - [Fast download times](##section=section_ProgressiveLoading)

These are just a few examples from our [features page](/Features.html). If
there's a hard problem that you keep running into, we want to solve it.

#### 2. Provide an integrated solution

Too many choices can make decision making difficult.  DoneJS simplifies
matters by providing a full stack of frontend tooling tested to work
great together.  The start of the [features page](/Features.html)
goes into detail with examples of this benefit.

_Note: Despite being an integrated solution, you can replace parts of
DoneJS with alternatives._


#### 3. Doing the right thing

Writing tests and documentation, setting up continuous integration and deployment
isn't fun or easy.  DoneJS tries to lower the barrier enough to
making doing the `right thing` simply part of the normal dev cycle.

Check out what DoneJS does for:

- [Tests](#section=section_ComprehensiveTesting)
- [Documentation](#section=section_Documentation)
- [Guides for CI and CD](#section=section_ContinuousIntegration_Deployment)
- [Modlets](#section=section_Modlets)
- [Generators](#section=section_Generators)

### Evolve

Application development and maintenence often
lasts many years. Stability is needed to release complex applications. However,
new techniques and best practices are constantly evolving.

DoneJS's goal is to strike a balance between immovable stability and irresistable
progress.  We do this by evolving frequently, while maintaining backward compatability between major releases.

It can be a bumpy road, with lots of little changes. But it
avoids rewrites, resulting in greater productivity:

DoneJS is the successor to JavaScriptMVC. If your project chose JavaScriptMVC in 2007, you would have made a wise decision, giving your team an upgrade path to a modern application for the past 8 years.

We hope to continue this trend until programs start writing themselves.

### Community

Software is better with friends.  Our goal is to establish a world-wide
community with people of all backgrounds and skill levels dedicated to
teaching, exploring and innovating.

#### Teaching

Technology is worth nothing if people don't know how to use it. We want
to create great learning material, but also create an environment
where people feel comfortable getting help.  

The core team is always available on [gitter](https://gitter.im/donejs/donejs)
and provides [weekly trainings](http://blog.bitovi.com/free-weekly-online-javascript-training/). Signup for a [meetup](/community.html) and we will come to your
city and teach you DoneJS!


#### Exploring

DoneJS has benefited greatly from other projects ideas and technology. It should continue to enhance other communities.  

You can already use many of DoneJS parts with other projects:

 - StealJS works great with ReactJS.  
 - CanJS works with RequireJS or Browserify.  
 - can-connect works on its own.  

We should always seek to cooperate with others.

#### Attract

If you have the next great JS idea, we want to encourage you to help build it as part of the DoneJS
family.  You'll find DoneJS a supportive environment to nurture your ideas.  You can even pair with the full time devs to build out your idea. Reach out to us on
[gitter](https://gitter.im/donejs/donejs) or create an issue.

Prashant is based in Bangalore, India. He likes the understated elegance of CanJS. I also believe DoneJS is a great framework in the making, since it makes technology selection a no brainer by uniquely offering developers an all-in-one technology stack.
