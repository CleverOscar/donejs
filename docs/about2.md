Building a web application is increasingly complicated.

Before you even start, there's a lot of work to be done. 

1. First, you need to choose what types of tools you want in your technology stack.
	
   Server side rendering? What is a virtual DOM? Do I need one? MVVM or Flux?
2. Then, you have to pick those tools. 
   
   React, Angular, or Backbone? Require.js, browserify, or jspm? Jasmine or QUnit? What tool will run my tests?
3. Then, you have to make sure those tools work together effectively. 

   Does require.js work well with Angular? Does Karma work with Browserify? What about React and Babel?
4. Finally (and this is usually an afterthought) how do you know the tools you chose will continue to innovate, or even exist, in the next 3-5 years of your application's lifespan? 

   Knockout and Backbone have stopped innovating. Batman.js no longer exists. Angular 1.x is a dead end.
5. Now go grab some coffee because it's time to start actually building your application.

Who has [time for all that](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starpolar/images/6/6b/Notime.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150225125846)? We think there should be a better way.

DoneJS' mission is to simplify life for you, Mr. JavaScript application developer. Get your app done, and get on with your life.

DoneJS gives you a full solution: literally everything you need to build a complex app, working together seamlessly. Its our mission to eliminate any ambiguity around choosing technology for building an app, so you can spend time actually building your app. 

We've compiled best in class tools for every part of the JavaScript application lifecycle: from tooling, to application architecture, to production deployment.

And as times change and new techniques emerge, we'll continue adding those to the stack, providing a simple upgrade path along the way.

With DoneJS, you don't have to think about steps 1-4, just focus on step 5.

DoneJS is rebuilt and rebranded from the 8+ year old [JavaScriptMVC](http://javascriptmvc.com) 
project. DoneJS is comprised of CanJS, StealJS, and many other sub-projects.

DoneJS' goal is to enable you to make amazing apps by default - high performance, real-time, maintainable, and cross-platform.
